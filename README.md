To use this software, you must do the following:
1- Upload NASA datasets into the Datasets folder. 
2-Upload the four types of patterns .csv files and the file risk_types.csv to the Patterns folder.
3- Run the module Phase1_Preprocessing.py. The output of this program is a collection of extracted text features. The output will be saved in the folder Text_Features
4- Run the module TFIDF-CAL.py. The output of this program is a TF-IDF weight. The output will be saved in the folder TFIDF_Features.
5- Run Kerasmodel.py module. The output is the ML model.
